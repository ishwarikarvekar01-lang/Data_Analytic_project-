ML Data Analysis Project – India Case Studies

Overview

This project consists of multiple data analysis case studies based on Indian datasets. It uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize data. The objective is to identify trends, compare state-wise statistics, and generate meaningful insights through graphical representations.

Project Files
1. covid_19_india.py
Purpose:
Analyzes COVID-19 pandemic data in India.

Functionality:
* Loads the COVID-19 dataset.
* Filters data for 14 July 2020.
* Identifies the Top 10 states with the highest confirmed cases.
* Identifies the Top 10 states with the highest recovered cases.

Visualizations:
* Bar chart of Top 10 states by confirmed cases.
* Bar chart of Top 10 states by recovered cases.

2. india_lpg_crisis.py
Purpose:
Analyzes the LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) crisis in India.

Functionality:
* Loads LPG crisis data.
* Examines the supply deficit percentage across states.
* Analyzes the percentage of households affected during the year 2026.

Visualizations:
* State-wise supply deficit percentage.
* State-wise household impact percentage.

3. India_cancer_patients.py
Purpose:
Analyzes cancer patient data in India from 2022–2025.

Functionality:
* Studies patient status such as Recovered, Deceased, and other categories.
* Performs state-wise analysis.
* Examines the distribution of cancer stages among deceased patients.

Visualizations:
* State-wise patient status bar chart.
* Cancer stage distribution among deceased patients.

4. India_traffic_violation.py
Purpose:
Analyzes traffic violations across different Indian states.

Functionality:
* Calculates total traffic violations per state.
* Categorizes violations based on their type or reason.
* Identifies states with the highest number of violations.

Visualizations:
* State-wise total traffic violations.
* Breakdown of traffic violation types by state.

Datasets
All datasets required for the project are stored in the datasets/ directory.

Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run
Run any analysis script using Python:
python covid_19_india.py
python india_lpg_crisis.py
python India_cancer_patients.py
python India_traffic_violation.py

Output
Each script performs data analysis and generates:
* Data summaries
* State-wise comparisons
* Bar charts and visualizations
* Insights based on the selected dataset

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and visualization techniques on real-world Indian datasets. It helps in understanding trends related to COVID-19, LPG supply, cancer patients, and traffic violations while providing graphical insights for better decision-making.
